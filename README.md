Using Python, HTML, JavaScript, and Firebase resources; our orginization created 2 different yet intertwined systems: 

1) An API retrieval for country data using python, stores in firestore database.

2) A data management system which allows for the display & storage of past & current data and carries out data processing and analysis for future use. 


Firebase services were also used to store our country data within a Firestore realtime database for use between all systems.
